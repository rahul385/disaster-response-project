## Project Overview <a name="project"></a>
The objective of this Machine Learning project is to analyze thousands of real messages sent during natural disasters either via social media or directly to disaster response organizations. 

[Disaster Resposne Web-Application](https://webapp-flask-disaster-response.herokuapp.com/)

Machine learning is critical to helping different disaster response organizations understand which messages are relevant to them and which messages to prioritize. During these disasters is when they have the least capacity to filter out messages that matter, and find basic methods such as using key word searches to provide trivial results. This disaster response pipeline will classify those text messages into several categories which can easily be monitored by respective disaster management organizations.

## File Description <a name="file"></a>

* **data**: This folder contains real messages received during a natural disaster in csv format.
    * `disaster_categories.csv`
    * `disaster_messages.csv`
    * `process_data.py` : This python module takes csv files as input containing messages and categories (labels), cleans and processes the data and then exports it into a database table.
    * `DisasterResponse.db` : The database file generated and saved after running python module "process_data.py"
    
* **models**: This folder contains real messages received during a natural disaster in csv format.
    * `train_classifier.py` : This file imports the data from database table and trains a Machine Learnin model to classify messages among 36 different categories.
    * `classifier.pkl` : The model generated and saved after running python module "train_classifier.py"
    * `utils.py` : Python module to clean, normalize and tokenize the text.

* **templates**: This folder contains real messages received during a natural disaster in csv format.
    * `go.html`
    * `master.html`

* **Visualizations**: This folder contains the images generated as part of analysis. These images are also displayed in the web application deployed on Heroku. 
    * `Message_Count_By_Category.PNG`
    * `Message_Count_By_Genre.PNG`

* **ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb**:  Jupyter notebook for process_data.py

* **ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for train_classifier.py

* **utils.py**: Python module to clean, normalize and tokenize the text.

* **run.py**: Main python module contains the entire executionflow and also renders visualizations on html.

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves the model
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. The web application deployed on Heroku can be accessed through the below URL
